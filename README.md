## Executive Summary

This paper presents an original theoretical framework for detecting non-luminous masses via gravitational inversion using absolute inertial coordinates. The concept of a Virtual Gravity Telescope is introduced to interpret gravitational signatures derived from motion, aiming to reveal hidden mass distributions.

The core innovation lies in calculating accelerations from assumed position data and subtracting the modeled gravitational influence of known bodies. The resulting residual accelerations may indicate the presence of unobserved masses.

What distinguishes this approach is the use of a globally fixed inertial origin—specifically (0,0,0) in Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) or Heliocentric Inertial (HCI) frames. This fixed-origin principle underpins a coherent vector field architecture, offering a potentially robust and consistent method for gravitational field inversion not found in existing literature [1][2].

This is a purely theoretical framework, with no experimental data, simulations, or code implementations. It serves as an original foundation for new gravitational reasoning.
