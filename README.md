### Executive Summary 

This paper presents an original theoretical framework for detecting non-luminous masses via gravitational inversion using absolute inertial coordinates. The concept of a Virtual Gravity Telescope is introduced to interpret gravitational signatures derived from motion, aiming to reveal hidden mass distributions.

The core innovation lies in explicitly defining and utilizing a globally fixed inertial origin—specifically coordinates (0,0,0)—in Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) or Heliocentric Inertial (HCI) frames as an essential conceptual basis. This fixed-origin principle underpins a coherent vector field architecture, offering a robust and conceptually clear method for gravitational field inversion, not explicitly found in existing literature [1][2].

This theoretical framework currently includes no experimental data, simulations, or implementations but serves as a foundational contribution to gravitational reasoning.
