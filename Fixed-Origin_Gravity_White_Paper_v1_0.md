## Executive Summary

This paper presents an original theoretical framework for detecting non-luminous masses via gravitational inversion using absolute inertial coordinates. The concept of a Virtual Gravity Telescope is introduced to interpret gravitational signatures derived from motion, aiming to reveal hidden mass distributions.

The core innovation lies in explicitly defining and utilizing a globally fixed inertial origin—specifically coordinates (0,0,0)—in Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) or Heliocentric Inertial (HCI) frames as an essential conceptual basis. This fixed-origin principle underpins a coherent vector field architecture, offering a robust and conceptually clear method for gravitational field inversion, not explicitly found in existing literature \[1]\[2].

This theoretical framework currently includes no experimental data, simulations, or implementations but serves as a foundational contribution to gravitational reasoning.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional astronomical observation relies primarily on electromagnetic signals, leaving many celestial bodies undetected due to their lack of observable emissions. Gravity, universally interacting with mass, provides an alternative observational approach \[3]\[4].

This framework infers hidden mass distributions through analyzing accelerations obtained from hypothetical position data:

*a(t) = d²x/dt²*

Subtracting gravitational influences from known masses yields residual accelerations potentially indicative of undetected masses \[5]\[6].

A distinctive aspect of this proposal is the explicit use of a fixed, absolute inertial origin. Unlike conventional treatments where coordinate fixation is merely practical convenience, this method elevates the coordinate origin to a fundamental conceptual and methodological principle.

Key governing equations:

*m · d²x/dt² = ΣF*
*div(a) = -4πGρ*

This method remains within Newtonian physics and the weak-field approximation of general relativity \[8].

## 2. Problem and Framework

Numerous astronomical masses remain invisible due to their non-emissive nature. Existing indirect detection methods, such as gravitational lensing and orbital perturbation analysis, lack an explicit, absolute spatial reference \[9]. This framework addresses this gap conceptually by proposing absolute inertial coordinates explicitly as the foundational element.

The proposed workflow includes:

* **Coordinate origin**: Explicitly fixed spatial origin (0,0,0) in ECI or HCI coordinates.
* **Object kinematics**: Hypothetical vector paths x(t).
* **Reference unification**: Common inertial frame mapping.
* **Signal filtering**: Theoretical denoising of input signals.
* **Acceleration estimation**: Central differencing to obtain a(t).
* **Field modeling**: Compute gravitational acceleration a\_model from known bodies.
* **Residual formation**: delta\_a = a(t) - a\_model(t).
* **Inversion process**: Solve div(delta\_a) = -4πGρ\_hidden.
* **Density mapping**: Reconstruction of hidden 3D mass distributions.

## 3. Theoretical Foundation and Originality

This conceptual framework introduces explicit originality in the historical and philosophical integration of Cartesian absolute coordinates (Descartes) and Newtonian absolute space into gravitational inversion methodology. Specifically, the innovation resides in explicitly identifying a fixed numerical coordinate origin (0,0,0) as crucial for consistent gravitational inference:

* **Cartesian Coordinates (Descartes)**: Introduction of fixed numerical origins simplified spatial reasoning historically.
* **Absolute Space (Newton)**: Newton introduced absolute space without explicitly specifying numerical coordinates.
* **Current Proposal (Figurelli)**: Explicit integration of Cartesian numerical origin as fundamental and essential for gravitational inversion.

Thus, the explicit declaration of a fixed-origin coordinate as foundational is conceptually original, bridging historical Cartesian-Newtonian views with modern gravitational techniques.

## 4. System Design

Components of the conceptual framework include:

* **Inputs**: Hypothetical kinematic vectors.
* **Reference alignment**: Data unified within absolute inertial coordinates.
* **Acceleration engine**: Calculation of instantaneous accelerations.
* **Gravitational model**: Theoretical gravitational computations.
* **Residual logic**: Residual acceleration formation.
* **Inversion**: Application of the Poisson equation.
* **Visualization**: Conceptual 3D spatial mass mapping.

## 5. Illustrative Scenarios

Potential conceptual applications:

* Detecting hidden outer planets.
* Mapping dark matter distributions.
* Identifying stealth satellites or orbital debris.
* Analyzing anomalous accelerations in interstellar trajectories.

## 6. Applications

Applications beyond astronomy:

* **Education**: Visualization and simulation of gravitational phenomena.
* **Geophysics**: Detecting subsurface masses.
* **Aerospace**: Enhancing navigation and anomaly detection.
* **Theoretical physics**: Exploring alternative gravitational models.

## 7. Future Work

The current theory is foundational. Recommended next steps include detailed simulations, mathematical validations, prototyping algorithms, and exploring real-world scenarios. Further research may refine the conceptual significance of fixed inertial coordinates.
