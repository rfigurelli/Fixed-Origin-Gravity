## Executive Summary

This paper presents an original theoretical framework for detecting non-luminous masses via gravitational inversion using absolute inertial coordinates. The concept of a Virtual Gravity Telescope is introduced to interpret gravitational signatures derived from motion, aiming to reveal hidden mass distributions.

The core innovation lies in calculating accelerations from assumed position data and subtracting the modeled gravitational influence of known bodies. The resulting residual accelerations may indicate the presence of unobserved masses.

What distinguishes this approach is the use of a globally fixed inertial origin—specifically (0,0,0) in Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) or Heliocentric Inertial (HCI) frames. This fixed-origin principle underpins a coherent vector field architecture, offering a potentially robust and consistent method for gravitational field inversion not found in existing literature [1][2].

This is a purely theoretical framework, with no experimental data, simulations, or code implementations. It serves as an original foundation for new gravitational reasoning.

## 1. Introduction

Astronomical observation traditionally depends on electromagnetic signals. However, many celestial bodies remain invisible due to their lack of radiation. Gravity, acting universally on all mass, provides an alternative path to detection [3][4].

This framework explores the inference of hidden mass distributions using the second derivative of position with respect to time:

*a(t) = d²x/dt²*

By subtracting the theoretical gravitational effects of known bodies from calculated accelerations, one obtains residuals that may correspond to unaccounted mass [5][6].

A defining aspect of this proposal is its reliance on a single, absolute inertial origin, eliminating relative-coordinate ambiguities and promoting spatially consistent inference [7].

Key governing equations include:

*m · d²x/dt² = ΣF*  
*div(a) = -4πGρ*

This method operates within Newtonian physics and the weak-field approximation of general relativity [8].

## 2. Problem and Framework

Many astronomical masses remain undetected due to their lack of observable emissions. While current techniques such as gravitational lensing and orbital perturbation analysis offer indirect evidence [9], no standard method exists for directly inferring mass density from residual acceleration fields mapped in fixed absolute inertial coordinates.

This framework proposes such a method in conceptual form.

The proposed workflow includes:

- **Coordinate origin**: A fixed spatial origin (0,0,0) in ECI or HCI coordinates  
- **Object kinematics**: Input of assumed vector paths x(t)  
- **Reference unification**: All data mapped to a common inertial frame  
- **Signal filtering**: Basic theoretical denoising applied to inputs  
- **Acceleration estimation**: a(t) computed via central differencing [10]  
- **Field modeling**: Theoretical gravitational acceleration a_model from known masses  
- **Residual formation**: delta_a = a(t) - a_model(t)  
- **Inversion process**: Solve div(delta_a) = -4πGρ_hidden  
- **Density mapping**: Hypothetical reconstruction of hidden 3D mass distributions

## 3. Theoretical Foundation

This is a conceptual framework with no empirical precedent. Its main innovations include:

- The use of a fixed inertial origin as a foundational assumption  
- The interpretation of residual accelerations as mass indicators  
- Applicability within Newtonian and post-Newtonian (weak-field) regimes  
- A workflow emphasizing coordinate consistency and spatial inversion over data fitting

Unlike traditional approaches such as gravitational lensing or perturbation analysis [9][10], this framework positions a fixed inertial reference not as convenience, but as an essential inference mechanism.

## 4. System Design

The framework consists of the following components:

- **Inputs**: Hypothetical kinematic vectors (positions over time)  
- **Reference alignment**: All data traced in an absolute inertial frame  
- **Acceleration engine**: Derives instantaneous accelerations  
- **Gravitational model**: Computes expected influence from known bodies  
- **Residual logic**: Compares observed vs. modeled acceleration  
- **Inversion**: Applies Poisson equation to estimate hidden mass density  
- **Visualization**: Outputs conceptual 3D spatial maps

## 5. Illustrative Scenarios

Possible conceptual applications include:

- Detection of unobserved outer planets  
- Mapping dark matter clumps  
- Identifying stealth satellites or debris  
- Analyzing anomalous accelerations during interstellar flybys

These are hypothetical and intended to illustrate the framework’s potential.

## 6. Applications

Beyond astronomy, the method may apply to:

- **Education**: Teaching gravity via simulation and visualization  
- **Geophysics**: Adapting the model to detect subterranean mass distributions  
- **Aerospace**: Improving navigation accuracy and anomaly detection  
- **Theoretical physics**: Exploring alternate gravitational scenarios

## 7. Future Work

This is a foundational theory. Next steps include simulation, mathematical validation, algorithm prototyping, and evaluation of real-world applicability. The fixed inertial coordinate principle may evolve with further research.
